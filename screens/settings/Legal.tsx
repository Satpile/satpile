        Your privacy is critically important to us.
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}GEEKKO SA Switzerland (“GEEKKO”) built the SATPILE mobile application (“SATPILE APP”) as a free
        application and the SATPILE.com website (“WEBSITE”) as an information platform, collectively called hereafter
        “SERVICES”. These SERVICES are provided by GEEKKO at no cost and are intended for use as is.
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}If you choose to use our SERVICES, you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this
        Privacy Policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the SERVICES. We
        will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. We store personal
        information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it. We don’t share any personally identifying
        information publicly or with third-parties, except when required to by law. We do our best to protect you from
        overreaching government demands for your personal information.
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}The app may use the third party service EXPO, which may collect information used to identify you.
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that
        we collect about you through the operation of our SERVICES. This is why we keep it to a strict minimum. We only
        ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful
        means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we’re collecting it and how it will be used.
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}You are free to refuse our request for your personal information, with the understanding that we may be
        unable to provide you with some of your desired SERVICES.
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}Links to Other Sites
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}Our Service may link to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link,
        you will be directed to that site. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of
        these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies. Therefore, we
        strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no
        responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}What This Policy Covers
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use the WEBSITE and/or the
        SATPILE APP.
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}Information We Collect
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services,
        to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}We collect this information from two sources: 1) if and when you provide information to us, and 2)
        automatically through operating our SERVICES.
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}1) Information You Provide to Us
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}We collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples:
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}- SATPILE does NOT require you to create an account in order to use the website nor the application.
        {"\n"}- Payment and contact information: If you buy something from us, we’ll collect information to process
        those payments and contact you. We also keep a record of the purchases you’ve made.
        {"\n"}- Communications with us: You may also provide us with information when you communicate with our engineers
        about a support question, or sign up for our newsletter. When you communicate with us via form, email, or
        otherwise, we store a copy of our communications.
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}2) Information We Collect Automatically
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}- Web logs information: Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers,
        mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device
        identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile
        network information.
        {"\n"}- Web Usage information: We collect information about your usage of our Services. We collect and use this
        information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}SATPILE does NOT use cookies nor other technologies like pixel tags. A cookie is a string of information
        that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time
        the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and
        emails.
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}How and Why We Use Information
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}We use information about you for the purposes listed below:
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}- To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services. For example, by providing automatic
        upgrades and new versions of our Services. Or, for example, by monitoring and analyzing how users interact with
        our Services so we can create new features that we think our users will enjoy and that will help them create and
        manage websites more efficiently or make our Services easier to use.
        {"\n"}- To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our marketing. For example,
        by targeting our marketing messages to groups of our users, advertising our Services, analyzing the results of
        our marketing campaigns, and understanding and forecasting user retention.
        {"\n"}- To protect our Services, our users, and the public. For example, by detecting security incidents;
        detecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; fighting spam; complying
        with our legal obligations; and protecting the rights and property of SATPILE and others, which may result in
        us, for example, declining a transaction or terminating Services.
        {"\n"}- To fix problems with our Services. For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing
        issues.
        {"\n"}- To customize the user experience. For example, to personalize your experience by serving you relevant
        notifications.
        {"\n"}- To communicate with you. For example, by emailing you to keep you up to date on our SERVICES. If you
        don’t want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (If you opt out, we may
        still send you important updates relating to security, for instance.)
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you
        under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that:
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}(1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable terms of service
        or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account — for example, in order to enable access
        to our website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or
        {"\n"}(2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or
        {"\n"}(3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or
        {"\n"}(4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information — for example, to provide and update our
        Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard our
        Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising; and to
        understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services; and to
        personalize your experience; or
        {"\n"}(5) You have given us your consent — for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access
        and analyze them later on, as described in our Cookie Policy.
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}Sharing Information
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}We do NOT share information with third parties, except when required to by law.
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}Legal and regulatory requirements: We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court
        order, or other governmental request.
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}We have a long-standing policy that we do not sell our users’ data. We aren’t a data broker, we don’t sell
        your personal information to data brokers, and we don’t sell your information to other companies that want to
        spam you with marketing emails.
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}How Long We Keep Information
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}We generally discard information about you when it’s no longer needed for the purposes for which we
        collect and use it and we’re not legally required to keep it.
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}- Limit access to information on your mobile device: Your mobile device operating system should provide
        you with the option to discontinue our ability to collect stored information or location information via our
        mobile apps. If you choose to limit this, you may not be able to use certain features, like geotagging for
        photographs.
        {"\n"}- Opt out of marketing communications: You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us.
        Just follow the instructions in those communications or let us know. If you opt out of promotional
        communications, we may still send you other communications, like those about your account and legal notices.
        {"\n"}- Set your browser to reject cookies: At this time, SATPILE WEBSITE does not use cookies. However, you can
        usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies from any website, with the drawback that
        certain features may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}Your Rights
        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}If you are located in certain parts of the world, including countries that fall under the scope of the

        {"\n"}
        {"\n"}When you contact us about one of your rights under this section, we’ll need to verify that you are the
        right person before we disclose or delete anything. For example, if you are a user, we will need you to contact
        us from the email address associated with your account. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a
        request on your behalf by giving us written authorization. We may still require you to verify your identity with
