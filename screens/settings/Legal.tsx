      Your privacy is critically important to us.
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}GEEKKO SA Switzerland (“GEEKKO”) built the SATPILE mobile
      application (“SATPILE APP”) as a free application and the SATPILE.com
      website (“WEBSITE”) as an information platform, collectively called
      hereafter “SERVICES”. These SERVICES are provided by GEEKKO at no cost and
      are intended for use as is.
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}If you choose to use our SERVICES, you agree to the collection and
      use of information in relation to this Privacy Policy. The Personal
      Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the
      SERVICES. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as
      described in this Privacy Policy. We store personal information for only
      as long as we have a reason to keep it. We don’t share any personally
      identifying information publicly or with third-parties, except when
      required to by law. We do our best to protect you from overreaching
      government demands for your personal information.
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}The app may use the third party service EXPO, which may collect
      information used to identify you.
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to
      provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the
      operation of our SERVICES. This is why we keep it to a strict minimum. We
      only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a
      service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your
      knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we’re collecting it and
      how it will be used.
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your
      personal information.
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}You are free to refuse our request for your personal information,
      with the understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of
      your desired SERVICES.
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}Links to Other Sites
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}Our Service may link to external sites that are not operated by us.
      If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site.
      Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of
      these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their
      respective privacy policies. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review
      the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume
      no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any
      third-party sites or services.
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}What This Policy Covers
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you
      when you use the WEBSITE and/or the SATPILE APP.
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}Information We Collect
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so —
      for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make
      our Services better.
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}We collect this information from two sources: 1) if and when you
      provide information to us, and 2) automatically through operating our
      SERVICES.
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}1) Information You Provide to Us
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}We collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are
      some examples:
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}- SATPILE does NOT require you to create an account in order to use
      the website nor the application.
      {"\n"}- Payment and contact information: If you buy something from us,
      we’ll collect information to process those payments and contact you. We
      also keep a record of the purchases you’ve made.
      {"\n"}- Communications with us: You may also provide us with information
      when you communicate with our engineers about a support question, or sign
      up for our newsletter. When you communicate with us via form, email, or
      otherwise, we store a copy of our communications.
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}2) Information We Collect Automatically
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}- Web logs information: Like most online service providers, we
      collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers
      typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique
      device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time
      of access, operating system, and mobile network information.
      {"\n"}- Web Usage information: We collect information about your usage of
      our Services. We collect and use this information to, for example,
      calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic
      regions.
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}SATPILE does NOT use cookies nor other technologies like pixel tags.
      A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s
      computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time
      the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks
      of code placed on websites and emails.
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}How and Why We Use Information
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}We use information about you for the purposes listed below:
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}- To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services. For
      example, by providing automatic upgrades and new versions of our Services.
      Or, for example, by monitoring and analyzing how users interact with our
      Services so we can create new features that we think our users will enjoy
      and that will help them create and manage websites more efficiently or
      make our Services easier to use.
      {"\n"}- To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the
      effectiveness of our marketing. For example, by targeting our marketing
      messages to groups of our users, advertising our Services, analyzing the
      results of our marketing campaigns, and understanding and forecasting user
      retention.
      {"\n"}- To protect our Services, our users, and the public. For example,
      by detecting security incidents; detecting and protecting against
      malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; fighting spam;
      complying with our legal obligations; and protecting the rights and
      property of SATPILE and others, which may result in us, for example,
      declining a transaction or terminating Services.
      {"\n"}- To fix problems with our Services. For example, by monitoring,
      debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.
      {"\n"}- To customize the user experience. For example, to personalize your
      experience by serving you relevant notifications.
      {"\n"}- To communicate with you. For example, by emailing you to keep you
      up to date on our SERVICES. If you don’t want to hear from us, you can opt
      out of marketing communications at any time. (If you opt out, we may still
      send you important updates relating to security, for instance.)
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds
      for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which
      is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that:
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}(1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you
      under the applicable terms of service or other agreements with you or is
      necessary to administer your account — for example, in order to enable
      access to our website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or
      {"\n"}(2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or
      {"\n"}(3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or
      those of another person; or
      {"\n"}(4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information — for
      example, to provide and update our Services; to improve our Services so
      that we can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard our
      Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the
      effectiveness of our advertising; and to understand our user retention and
      attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services; and to
      personalize your experience; or
      {"\n"}(5) You have given us your consent — for example before we place
      certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on, as
      described in our Cookie Policy.
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}Sharing Information
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}We do NOT share information with third parties, except when required
      to by law.
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}Legal and regulatory requirements: We may disclose information about
      you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}We have a long-standing policy that we do not sell our users’ data.
      We aren’t a data broker, we don’t sell your personal information to data
      brokers, and we don’t sell your information to other companies that want
      to spam you with marketing emails.
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}How Long We Keep Information
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}We generally discard information about you when it’s no longer
      needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it and we’re not
      legally required to keep it.
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}You have several choices available when it comes to information
      about you:
      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}- Limit access to information on your mobile device: Your mobile
      device operating system should provide you with the option to discontinue
      our ability to collect stored information or location information via our
      mobile apps. If you choose to limit this, you may not be able to use
      certain features, like geotagging for photographs.
      {"\n"}- Opt out of marketing communications: You may opt out of receiving
      promotional communications from us. Just follow the instructions in those
      communications or let us know. If you opt out of promotional
      communications, we may still send you other communications, like those
      about your account and legal notices.
      {"\n"}- Set your browser to reject cookies: At this time, SATPILE WEBSITE
      does not use cookies. However, you can usually choose to set your browser
      to remove or reject browser cookies from any website, with the drawback
      that certain features may not function properly without the aid of
      cookies.
      {"\n"}

      {"\n"}
      {"\n"}If you are located in certain parts of the world, including

      {"\n"}When you contact us about one of your rights under this section,
      we’ll need to verify that you are the right person before we disclose or
      delete anything. For example, if you are a user, we will need you to
      contact us from the email address associated with your account. You can
